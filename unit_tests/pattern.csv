# The pattern is written as CSV and is to be read by test-tsdbwAPI
# I used LibreOffice Calc to create this pattern
# Export as CSV, field delim ',', character set UTF-8 which is 1 byte long
# characters for ASCII ones
# Number of rows will be number of metrics, the last digit in the first row
# indicates overal number of epochs in the pattern
# Think of it as of table: rows are metrics, columns are epochs and
# values in the cells are those to be written into TSDB within
# that epoch for that metric. If no value is provided, then no value
# will be written into TSDB for the relevant metric within relevant epoch
