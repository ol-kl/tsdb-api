This API is based on refactored version of the original TSDB API implementtation.
Original (the first version): https://svn.ntop.org/svn/ntop/trunk/tsdb/
Refactored verion: https://github.com/gar1t/tsdb

he purpose of this project - to tailor TSDB for storing network measurement information which can be fed into DB quite fast. Thus we need fast writing time in order to be ready to write next update. The eventual goal is tight integration with SNMP routines, which query devices, collect metrics and push them endowed with a time-stamp into TSDB as fast as possible. Subsequent routines will query the DB to fetch relevant data and plot it.

To profile read / write time of the TSDB with 1 000 000 time series and 60 epochs, see bin/test-tsdbAPI -h.
The project requires the libdb-dev package as well as complied and installed libcsv (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/)


Authors' original message:
TSDB (TimeSeries DataBase)
--------------------------

Timeseries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) are used to represent events at specific times. Popular tools such as rrdtool (http://www.rrdtool.org) made it possible to handle time series easily. Unfortunately RRD falls short when
- handling thousand/million time series due to high update time and disk-space used
- data have to be exported on a web 2.0 GUI

For this reason we developed TSDB.
